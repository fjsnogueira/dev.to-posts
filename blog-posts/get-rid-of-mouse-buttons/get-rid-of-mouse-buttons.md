A few months ago my computer mouse stopped working so I bought one of those cheap ones. It is workign like a charm but unfortunatelly it has two very very anoying side buttons:

![](./assets/photo.jpg)

I don't remember ever using them. Most of the time they and me coexist peacefully but sometimes (often when my wife is in front of the computer) the get clicked accidentally. It is not a drama after all, you think? Well it is if you are sitting in front of your email provider's sending mask, typing a large text into it and accidentally click this strange side button that is mapped to the *back* button...

So I always wanted to get rid of them, but:

+ Windows is not able to control those buttons
+ the manufacturer does not provide a software for it
+ removing the buttons from the mouse is not really a satisfactory solution for that problem

# The very last solution
Today I scanned my bookshelf and suddenly an old book, bought and read about 12 years ago, catches the eye:

After reading the table of contents:

![](./assets/toc.jpg)

I saw the part with *Hooks*. And suddenly something I've done several years ago came back into my mind. Windows is based upon a [message system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/messages-and-message-queues) and there is a powerful function that let's you inspect every message. And in one case you are also able to modify the messages. So maybe you got my idea: Listen to a specific message and omit it so that the mouse clicks never reaches any application.

# Windows Message
If you press a key, some sends somewhere a `*WM_CHAR*` message. If you press the left mouse button, a `*WM_LBUTTONDOWN*` is sent. Those events are fetched by applications that respond to them or omit them.
E.g. having a WPF application with just a single button:

![](./assets/wpf-single-btn.jpg)

Introduces a consumer of `*WM_LBUTTOMDOWN*` events and of course it also consumes the corresponding `*WM_LBUTTONUP*` events.

# See windows messages in action
If you have `Visual Studio` installed, you have access to a little tool from Microsoft, called `Spy++`. You find it in the installation directory, e.g.:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\Common7\Tools
```

The folder contains two versions, a 32 Bit and a 64 Bit version. You must choose it based on the bitness of the application you want to inspect. The WPF application is JITed as 32Bit application so I open that version. Click onto the button I've marked red in this screenshot. A new window appears:

![](./assets/spypp-2.jpg)

Now click onto the crossfade, hold the button, move it over the application you are interested in and click the "*OK*" button. You are now tracing that application:

![](./assets/spypp-4.jpg)

You see, there is a bunch of messages that were emitted all the time.

# Determine the right message
So you know that there is a message if something happens on the keyboard or the mouse. How do you know what message we are interested in? Just trigger it and "listen" to the message stream. In this case I recommend to remember the last row number:

![](./assets/spypp-5.jpg)

Then place the mouse over the test app and press one of the side button. In my case the last message right before the click was: **1730** Right click onto the message stream and stop recording:

![](./assets/spypp-6.jpg)

You now have a bunch of new messages. I wish you luck in finding the right one :smile: In my case I assumed that `WM_XBUTTONDOWN` is what I am looking for:

![](./assets/spypp-7.jpg)

Of course, just an assumption.

# Hooking 
We have to differentiate between a `local hook` and a `global hook`. As statet in [the official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/about-hooks#hook-procedures) a global hook can monitor all events in all threads and must be placed into a own DLL.

To register a hook, we use `[SetWindowsHookEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa)`. It requires the `type of the hook` as first parameter. To get a full list of possible values, refer [to the official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa?redirectedfrom=MSDN#parameters).

# Blocking a message
We are interested in `WH_GETMESSAGE`. Whenever a windows application calls `GetMessage()` to retrive the next message for dispatching (every application is doing this all the time :smile:), `WH_GETMESSAGE` is emitted. This is the only place where [you can modify the message](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms644981(v=vs.85)#remarks). After returning from the hook callback, the message is passed to the application that calls `GetMessage()`. So whatever you write into the message will be visible to callee. This means, here we can adjust the message to prevent `WM_XBUTTONDOWN` being processed.

# Writing the start application
My intention is, to have a small application, staying in the systray, that provides three functions:
+ Enable Buttons
+ Disable Buttons
+ Close App

## Calling unmanaged code from C#
As already mentioned, we need a DLL to make this happen. I am writing the DLL in C++ and thus we need to call unmanaged code from our managed application. Fortunatelly C#/.NET makes it easy for us to do so! Let's say there exist two methods: `SetHook` and `RemoveHook` (with std calling convention) and the dll will be named *DLL1.dll*, then you simple have to put those two `DllImport` statements at the root of the application's class:

```cs
[DllImport("Dll1.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.StdCall)]
public static extern void SetHook();

[DllImport("Dll1.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.StdCall)] 
public static extern void RemoveHook();
```

Very easy! 

## Systray Icon
I suggest you to take a look at the source code. There is nothing special. I used a WinForms application type because there it is much easier than with a WPF application.
